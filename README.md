Welcome to MSP430DLL!

MSP430DLL is a convenient Python wrapper for TI MSP430 (tool) developers.

This is still work in progress and reasonable documentation has to be wrritten...

### Prerequisites

**Note**: If you are using out-of-the-box DLLs (32-bit), you also need a 32-bit Python version (PyPy also works fine)!
